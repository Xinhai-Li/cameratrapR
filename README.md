Estimate animal population density using camera trap data.

Camera trapping is widely used in wildlife survey, yet methods for estimating population density with trapping data are scattered in different literatures, therefore not easily accessible. We are trying to combine the available methods into one package: cameraTrap. Especially, we designed a new method to estimate the density of species that can not be individually identified. This method is based on the simulation of animal movement behavior. The parameters of the movement for each species are predefined (we will provide movement parameters for a number of species). Currently the package has functions to: plot the camera trapping results, simulation animal movements and demonstrate footprint chains, calculate population density and its confident intervals. The data of camera trapping conducted in Changbaishan Nature Reserve (in Northeast China) are provided for running the functions.
